    First pass,Use diff XOR each element to obtain the XOR of two special element
    Second pass
    If we use the example on leetcode , the diff is 2 Binary(10)
    The XOR of two special element could separate the nums in two nums array.
   
    if the second position of num is 1,then calculate the XOR in res[1],if not,do it in res[0]
    We could use a res[2] to store the result.
    then the res[0] and res[1] is the answer.
